Pagination Readme.md
Overview
This document provides guidelines and information about pagination within our software project/application. Pagination is used to break down large sets of data or content into smaller, more manageable parts for display.

Purpose
The purpose of pagination is to enhance user experience by:

Improving page load times.
Reducing server load by fetching and displaying data in smaller chunks.
Enhancing readability and navigation through large datasets.
Usage
Basic Pagination
To implement basic pagination, follow these steps:

Determine Pagination Parameters: Decide on the number of items to display per page and the total number of items to paginate.
Calculate Number of Pages: Determine the total number of pages based on the total number of items and items per page.
Display Pagination Controls: Render pagination controls such as page numbers, previous/next buttons, and navigation links.
Handle Pagination Logic: Implement logic to fetch and display the appropriate data based on the selected page.
Advanced Pagination
For more advanced pagination features such as dynamic loading or lazy loading, consider the following:

Dynamic Loading: Load additional content dynamically as the user scrolls down the page.
Lazy Loading: Delay the loading of content until it's needed, improving initial page load times.
Best Practices
Limit Page Size: Keep the number of items per page reasonable to maintain optimal performance.
Provide Navigation Feedback: Clearly indicate to users which page they are currently viewing.
Accessibility: Ensure pagination controls are accessible and usable for all users, including those with disabilities.
