Caching System Readme
In this project, we explore caching systems, their various strategies, and their significance in software engineering. By the end of this project, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of caching systems, including FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, LFU, their purposes, and their limitations.

General Concepts
What is a Caching System?
A caching system is a mechanism employed in software engineering to temporarily store frequently accessed or computationally expensive data. It acts as a high-speed access layer between the application and the data source, reducing latency and improving performance.

Key Acronyms
FIFO: First-In-First-Out. This caching strategy prioritizes evicting the oldest (earliest) cached entries first.
LIFO: Last-In-First-Out. Contrary to FIFO, LIFO prioritizes evicting the most recently cached entries first.
LRU: Least Recently Used. LRU caching evicts the least recently accessed entries from the cache when it reaches its capacity limit.
MRU: Most Recently Used. MRU caching evicts the most recently accessed entries from the cache.
LFU: Least Frequently Used. LFU caching evicts the least frequently accessed entries from the cache.
Purpose of a Caching System
The primary purpose of a caching system is to enhance application performance by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch or compute data. By storing frequently accessed data closer to the application, caching minimizes latency and improves responsiveness, leading to a better user experience.

Limitations of Caching Systems
While caching systems offer significant performance benefits, they also have limitations. Some of these limitations include:

Cache Invalidation: Ensuring that cached data remains consistent with the data source can be challenging, especially in distributed systems.
Cache Size: Caches have finite sizes, and caching too much data can lead to memory pressure and potential performance degradation.
Cache Consistency: Maintaining consistency across distributed caches or in the presence of concurrent updates requires careful design and coordination.
Cold Starts: Initially populating an empty cache can introduce latency, known as a cold start, which can impact performance.
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you will be able to:

Explain the concept of a caching system and its importance in software engineering.
Define FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU caching strategies and articulate their differences.
Discuss the purpose of caching systems in improving application performance.
Identify the limitations and challenges associated with caching systems and propose strategies to mitigate them.
By mastering these concepts, you will be equipped to design and implement effective caching solutions that optimize application performance while mitigating potential drawbacks.
